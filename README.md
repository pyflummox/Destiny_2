# Destiny 2 Fractaline Automated Program.
Python v2.7.16

Author: pyFlummox
version: 1.0 - does not currently support all possible frames.

Description: This program was created for one purpose, to automate the donating and frame dismatling process of the Empyrean Foundation in Destiny 2. It uses mostly pyautogui commands with positions where mouse events happen. It gives ample delay in game so clicks are registered in-game.

Modules used: pyautogui, time, sys, cv2

Functionality of script:
The script has a few options in it. When you first launch the program you must be at the tower oblesk menu in Destiny 2. Once the program starts it will ask you which frame you want to farm. You need to type 1 of the 4 possible frame's number only. Then, the program is ask if you want to auto dismantle, type y or n (yes or no). The final prompt will ask how many loops you want to run. If you aren't auto dismantling I would suggest typing the number 4. After that you must be tabbed in to Destiny 2 for the program to work.
