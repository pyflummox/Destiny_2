# Destiny 2 Fractaline Automated Program.
Python v2.7.16

Author: pyFlummox

version: 1.2.6.5

Added a feature to repeat the options in the last run of the program. 

Description: This program was created for one purpose, to automate the donating and frame dismatling process of the Empyrean Foundation in Destiny 2. It uses mostly pyautogui commands with positions where mouse events happen. It gives ample delay in game so clicks are registered in-game.

Modules used: pyautogui, time, sys, cv2, os.path, os

**Running the program:**

1. When running the program for the first time it will ask you for you key mapping for quest and character in Destiny 2. These will be stored in a file so you don't have to enter them each time you run the program. 

2. The program will ask you which weapon you want to farm, press only the number then press enter.

3. Audo dismantle is a feature I created to dismantle all of the weapons bounties you just claimed, this is an option. Press y/n (yes/no).

4. The next prompt will ask you how many loops of x (x=4 or x=7. perfect paradox allows you get to 6-7 frames instead of 4) you want to automate.

5. After that you have 3 seconds to tab into destiny 2 and let the program begin. 


Notes:
if you are choosing not to use the auto dismantle feature I would suggest only looping the program (see **Running the program (5)**) 4-5 times as it will fill your post master x times(x=4 or x=7. perfect paradox allows you get to 6-7 frames instead of 4.)

You need the Legendary_lock.png file in the same directory as the .exe file. 


Resolution originally developed in 3440x1440 21:9 with pyautogui. I added support for 2560x1440 16:9 and 1920x1080 16:9.

The below keybinds need to be mapped in Destiny 2

'f' for dismantle
